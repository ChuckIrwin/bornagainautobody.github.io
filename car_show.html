                <p> Some of the cars in the <a href="portfolio-pg1.html">portfolio</a> were headed for the scrap heap,  but the owners saw what the car could be 
				with some care and hard work. Cars were created by man and can be recreated by man. Man because of sin, has found 
				himself on the scrap heap of life, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). Even if we 
				look good on the outside, our hearts are not right with God, it is like rust under the paint. God, our creator, is 
				the only one who can make us new. Jesus answered and said unto him, verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be 
				<b>born again</b>, he cannot see the kingdom of God.(John 3:3)<br><br>

				God's desire for us is that we will no longer be that old wreck rusted in sin, but that we would be <b>born again</b>. No one
				would think that a car could restore itself. The same is true for each of us, we need our creator. For God so loved the
				world that he gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life (John 3:16).
				Our own efforts will amount to nothing because we are sinners and our creator is holy. For by grace are <br>ye saved through faith, 
				and that not of yourselves; lest any man should boast (Eph. 2:8-9). Only God can take the wreak of a sin stained life and make it 
				new. Marvel not that I said unto thee, ye must be <b>born again</b> (John 3:7). This day God wants you to place your faith and trust in Him. 
				He says that what you do will bring death, but the gift that He wants to give you is eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23).
				If we confess our sin, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9). This 
				is the way that we get rid of the rust under the paint. Would this not be a wonderful day to ask Jesus Christ to forgive your sin and
				make your heart new.Then you would be <b>born again</b>. Amen.</p>
